  To address this question, we set up an experiment in which a human information
  provider (IP) was given their information only in a delayed and incremental
  manner, which systematically created situations where the IP had the turn but
  could not provide task-related information.
  Our data analysis shows that 1) IPs bridge the gap until they can provide
  information by re-purposing a whole variety of task- and grounding-related
  communicative actions (e.g. echoing the user's request, signaling
  understanding, asserting partially relevant information), rather than being
  silent or explicitly asking for time (e.g. "please wait"), and that 2) IPs
  combined these actions productively to ensure an ongoing conversation. These
  results, we argue, indicate that natural conversational interfaces should also
  be able to manage their time flexibly using a variety of conversational
  resources.},

    abstract = "RNN-based sequence generation is now widely used in NLP and NLG (natural language generation). Most work focusses on how to train RNNs, even though also decoding is not necessarily straightforward: previous work on neural MT found seq2seq models to radically prefer short candidates, and has proposed a number of beam search heuristics to deal with this. In this work, we assess decoding strategies for referring expression generation with neural models. Here, expression length is crucial: output should neither contain too much or too little information, in order to be pragmatically adequate. We find that most beam search heuristics developed for MT do not generalize well to referring expression generation (REG), and do not generally outperform greedy decoding. We observe that beam search heuristics for termination seem to override the model{'}s knowledge of what a good stopping point is. Therefore, we also explore a recent approach called trainable decoding, which uses a small network to modify the RNN{'}s hidden state for better decoding results. We find this approach to consistently outperform greedy decoding for REG.",

    abstract = "Zero-shot learning in Language {\&} Vision is the task of correctly labelling (or naming) objects of novel categories. Another strand of work in L{\&}V aims at pragmatically informative rather than {``}correct{''} object descriptions, e.g. in reference games. We combine these lines of research and model zero-shot reference games, where a speaker needs to successfully refer to a novel object in an image. Inspired by models of {``}rational speech acts{''}, we extend a neural generator to become a pragmatic speaker reasoning about uncertain object categories. As a result of this reasoning, the generator produces fewer nouns and names of distractor categories as compared to a literal speaker. We show that this conversational strategy for dealing with novel objects often improves communicative success, in terms of resolution accuracy of an automatic listener.",

  abstract     = {Synthetic speech can be used to express uncertainty in dialogue
systems by means of hesitation. If a phrase like “Next
to the green tree” is uttered in a hesitant way, that is, containing
lengthening, silences, and fillers, the listener can infer that
the speaker is not certain about the concepts referred to. However,
we do not know anything about the referential domain of
the uncertainty; if only a particular word in this sentence would
be uttered hesitantly, e.g. “the greee:n tree”, the listener could
infer that the uncertainty refers to the color in the statement,
but not to the object. In this study, we show that the domain
of the uncertainty is controllable. We conducted an experiment
in which color words in sentences like “search for the green
tree” were lengthened in two different positions: word onsets or
final consonants, and participants were asked to rate the uncertainty
regarding color and object. The results show that initial
lengthening is predominantly associated with uncertainty about
the word itself, whereas final lengthening is primarily associated
with the following object. These findings enable dialogue
system developers to finely control the attitudinal display of uncertainty,
adding nuances beyond the lexical content to message
delivery.},
