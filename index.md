I am a tenure-track professor for language technology, machine learning and digital humanities at the [Computer Science Department, Jena](https://www.fmi.uni-jena.de/). In more simple terms: I am a computational linguist. The general goal of my research is to build computational models of language use in text and dialogue, with applications in natural language generation, dialogue systems, language & vision.

Before becoming a real (junior) professor in 2019, I worked as a temporary professor for theoretical and applied computational linguistics in Bielefeld. I did a PostDoc at [CITEC,  Bielefeld](https://www.cit-ec.de/de), a PhD at [IMS, Stuttgart](https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/) and got my Magister (Master) degree in Computational Linguistics from the [Linguistics Department, Potsdam](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/ling/index.html).
